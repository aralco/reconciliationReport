Reconciliation Report
**********************************************************************
Requirements:
    a. MySQL server 5.x installed and configured.
    b. transactionQueueDB schema running on MySQL server.
    c. Java SDK 1.6.0_37
    d. Maven 3.0.x installed.

Installation:
    2. Make sure that “database.properties” file matches your database configuration.
    3. Also make sure to check “email.properties” file, in order to allow the application send emails from and to an
    email account. For testing purposes you can use a gmail account for the from email account. EnvelopeTo should
    contain an email or  a comma separated list of emails to send the report.
    4. After that you should be ready to package the ReconciliationReport. To do it you should go to the terminal console
     and under the folder “reconciliationReport” you must run the following commands:
        - $mvn clean
        - $mvn package
    5.	If execution of the above processes are successful, a “target” folder will be created under
    reconciliationReport folder.
    6.	Assuming you are still on “reconciliationReport ” folder run the following command in order to run
    ReconciliationReport:
        - $java –jar target/ReconciliationReport.one-jar.jar
    7. In order to manually package a tarball file for production we must keep the following file structure:
        - reconciliationReport (Folder)
                |
                |__ target (Folder)
                |
                |__ ReconciliationReport.one-jar.jar (Jar file)

       Then you will be able to execute jar file as in previous step:
        - $ java –jar target/ReconciliationReport.one-jar.jar
    8. At this point ReconciliationReport will retrieve data from transactionQueueDB. SUCCESS/FAILURE transactions from
    TransactionQueue table will be fetch and stored in a CSV file (see image below), the same that will be sent as
    attachment to citi retention system via SMTP message to email(s) defined on 2.c. Also TransactionQueryHistory table
    will be updated with queryType to RECONCILIATION value and timestamp to current date. To keep a record of reports
    sent to citi retention system, each successfully sent message will be stored on ReconciliationReportLog table.

Changes:
    - Updated EmailService.java file.
